# "I have who has" Generator

Generate a list of "I have who has" cards, with an answer key.

So far it is not very configurable, and only supports time.
It also requires you to edit the js file to make changes to the time.

Enhancements:
* Allow user to type in list of times to be used
* Option to randomly generate specified number of cards
* Option to randomly generate card times
  * To the hour (obviously limited to 12 cards max)
  * Include half-hour
  * Include quarter-hour
  * Include any time
